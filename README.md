This course is for anyone who wants to learn more advanced NLP methods. Instructor Gwendolyn Stripling, PhD, begins with a look at the fundamental concepts and principles of NLP, including the evolution and significance of natural language processing. She then reviews some NLP and Python basics—and introduces the NLP library spaCy—before jumping into more modern techniques and advancements in natural language processing using Transformer Models like GPT and BERT. Methods such as supervised fine-tuning, parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) give you the foundational knowledge you need to improve large language model (LLM) performance. Learn the ways you can apply NLP in your applications and day-to-day, including how to analyze customer sentiments Each chapter ends with a challenge and solution, so you can test your knowledge as you go.
